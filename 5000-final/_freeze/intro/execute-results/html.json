Assume that your audience\\\n    is not an expert in the application field.\n\n-   Is there any prior research on your topic that might be helpful for the audience?\n\nThe goal of the introduction it to capture the audience's interest in your paper. An introduction that starts with \"Diabetes kills over 87 thousand people each year and in many cases may be preventable\" is more engaging than \"This paper is about diabetes prevention\".\n\nThe introduction should be 2-4 paragraphs long.\n:::\n",
