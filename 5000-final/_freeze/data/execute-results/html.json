Answer **at least** **all** of the following questions:\n\n-   How was the data collected?\n\n-   What are the sources and influences of bias in the data?\n\n-   What are the important features (=columns) that you are using in your analysis? What do they mean?\n\nFeel free to add anything else that you think is necessary for understanding the paper and the context of the problem.\n:::\n",
