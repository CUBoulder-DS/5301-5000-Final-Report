For example, Bhav's work is in `5000-final/BJ_work.rmd`.\n\n\n::: callout-note\n## From the report requirements\n\nA 3-5 summary of the paper. It should address the research question, the methods, and the conclusions of your analysis.\n\n*\"A good recipe for an abstract is: first sentence: specify the general area of the paper and encourage the reader; second sentence: specify the dataset and methods at a general level; third sentence: specify the headline result; and a fourth sentence about implications.\"*\n:::\n",
