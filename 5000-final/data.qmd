# Data Exploration


We describe the data here. Note that the default global setting for Quarto is set to NOT output the code into the rendered document, aka only including the results of any R code.

**We should include a print of the head of the dataframe of our data, along with some sample images!!**

## From the report requirements

This section should describe the data you'll be using. Answer **at least** **all** of the following questions:

-   How was the data collected?

-   What are the sources and influences of bias in the data?

-   What are the important features (=columns) that you are using in your analysis? What do they mean?

Feel free to add anything else that you think is necessary for understanding the paper and the context of the problem.

## Data Selection (UTK Dataset) - LN DV

Motivation - has there been progress against bias?

Reference Articles from Ethics Class - Joy B's work, etc.  Lots of disparity back in 2018, how much of that still exists with free models?
