## From the report requirements

This section introduces your problem to a **non-expert** audience, describes the context and history of the problem.

For example, if your overall project topic is on Diabetes Prevention and Prediction, then you would use the Introduction to introduce what diabetes is, who it affects, why prevention is important, history on diabetes prevention, etc.

Some questions that you could answer in the introduction:

-   What is the "research question"? why is it interesting or worth answering?

-   What is the relevant background information for readers to understand your project? Assume that your audience\
    is not an expert in the application field.

-   Is there any prior research on your topic that might be helpful for the audience?

The goal of the introduction it to capture the audience's interest in your paper. An introduction that starts with "Diabetes kills over 87 thousand people each year and in many cases may be preventable" is more engaging than "This paper is about diabetes prevention".

The introduction should be 2-4 paragraphs long.
