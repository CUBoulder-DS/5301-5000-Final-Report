This is where all the plots will go!!!! Here are some examples of plot layout:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Tabbed example output
```{r  ex2}
#| label: fig-sec4-ex2
#| fig-cap: ANother example caption
#| fig-subcap: 
#|   - Subcap
#|   - Subcap 2
#| layout-ncol: 2

f <- 1:10
## Tabbed example output
ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x=f, y=f^2))

ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x=f, y=1/f))
```

## Example outout
```{r ex1}
#| label: fig-sec4-ex1
#| fig-cap: A caption for generated figure
# Example code that's running
f <- 1:10
f

```

## From the report requirements

Describe the results of your analysis using visualizations, descriptive statistics, tables and similar.

Don't focus too much on the implications in this section -- that's what the next section is for. Just present the numbers/graphs.
