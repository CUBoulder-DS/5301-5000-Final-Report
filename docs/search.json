For example, Bhav’s work is in 5000-final/BJ_work.rmd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the report requirements\n\n\n\nA 3-5 summary of the paper. It should address the research question, the methods, and the conclusions of your analysis.\n“A good recipe for an abstract is: first sentence: specify the general area of the paper and encourage the reader; second sentence: specify the dataset and methods at a general level; third sentence: specify the headline result; and a fourth sentence about implications.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarkkainen, Kimmo, and Jungseock Joo. 2021. “FairFace: Face Attribute Dataset for Balanced Race, Gender, and Age for Bias Measurement and Mitigation.” In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, 1548–58."

    "text": "From the report requirements\n\n\n\nThis section introduces your problem to a non-expert audience, describes the context and history of the problem.\nFor example, if your overall project topic is on Diabetes Prevention and Prediction, then you would use the Introduction to introduce what diabetes is, who it affects, why prevention is important, history on diabetes prevention, etc.\nSome questions that you could answer in the introduction:\n\nWhat is the “research question”? why is it interesting or worth answering?\nWhat is the relevant background information for readers to understand your project? Assume that your audience\nis not an expert in the application field.\nIs there any prior research on your topic that might be helpful for the audience?\n\nThe goal of the introduction it to capture the audience’s interest in your paper. An introduction that starts with “Diabetes kills over 87 thousand people each year and in many cases may be preventable” is more engaging than “This paper is about diabetes prevention”.\nThe introduction should be 2-4 paragraphs long."
