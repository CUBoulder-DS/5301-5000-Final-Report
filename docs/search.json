Gaining a statistically significant result would allow us to reject our null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. In other words, rejecting the original assumption means there is a statistically large enough difference between the source data and output data, and could indicate a bias in model.\nWe’ll be testing across different subsets contained within the data, as listed below:\n\n3.3.1 Demographics\n\nAge Group\nGender\nRace\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Demographics’ Subgroups\n\nAge Group (9 groups)\n\n0-2\n3-9\n10-19\n20-29\n30-39\n40-49\n50-59\n60-69\n70-130\n\nGender (2 groups)\n\nFemale\nMale\n\nRace (5 groups)\n\nAsian\nBlack\nIndian\nOther\nWhite\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 The General Proportion Tests\nOur hypothesis tests will be testing different proportions within these subgroups between the source data and the output data.\nThe general format of our hypothesis tests will be:\n\\(H_0: p = p_{\\text{Source Data Subset}}\\)\n\\(H_A: p \\neq p_{\\text{Source Data Subset}}\\)\nWith the following test statistic:\n\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{p} - p)}{\\sqrt{p(1 - p)}}\\)\nWith the p-value being calculated by:\n\\(P(|Z| &gt; \\hat{p} | H_0)\\)\n\\(= P(|Z| &gt; \\frac{\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{p} - p)}{\\sqrt{p(1 - p)}})\\),\nwhere\n\n\\(n\\): output data subset size\n\\(\\hat{p}\\): output data subset proportion\n\\(p\\): source data subset proportion\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Notation\nBefore we list the specific tests, we should introduce some notation.\nLet \\(R\\) be race, then \\(R \\in \\{Asian, Black, Indian, Other, White\\} = \\{A, B, I, O, W\\}\\)\nLet \\(G\\) be gender, then \\(G \\in \\{Female, Male\\} = \\{F, M\\}\\)\nLet \\(A\\) be age, then \\(A \\in \\{[0,2], [3,9], [10,19], [20,29], [30,39], [40,49], [50,59], [60,69], [70,130]\\} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}\\)\nLet \\(D\\) be the dataset, then \\(D \\in \\{Source, Fairface, Deepface\\} = \\{D_0, D_f, D_d\\}\\)\n\n\n3.3.5 More Specific Proportion Tests\nUsing this notation, we can simplify our nomenclature for testing a certain proportion of an overall demographic.\nFor example, we can test if the proportion of Female in the Fairface output is statistically different than the proportion of Female from the source.\nHypothesis Test:\n\\(H_0: p_F = p_{F|D_0}\\)\n\\(H_A: p_F \\neq p_{F|D_0}\\)\nP-value Calculation:\n\\(P(|Z| &gt; \\frac{\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{p} - p)}{\\sqrt{p(1 - p)}})\\),\nwhere\n\n\\(p = p_{F|D_0}\\): proportion of females from the source data\n\\(\\hat{p} = p_{F|D_f}\\): proportion of females from the fairface output\n\\(n = n_{F \\cup M|D_f}\\): number of data points in the gender subset form the fairface output\n\nAdditionally, we could test for different combinations of subsets within demographics. For instance, if we wanted to test for a statistically significant difference between the proportion of those who Female, given that they were Black, then we could write a hypothesis test like:\n\\(H_0: p_{F|B} = p_{F|D_0 \\cap B}\\)\n\\(H_A: p_{F|B} \\neq p_{F|D_0 \\cap B}\\)\nP-value Calculation:\n\\(P(|Z| &gt; \\frac{\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{p} - p)}{\\sqrt{p(1 - p)}})\\),\nwhere\n\n\\(p = p_{F|D_0 \\cap B}\\): proportion of females from the source data, given they were black\n\\(\\hat{p} = p_{F|D_f \\cap B}\\): proportion of females from the fairface output, given they were black\n\\(n = n_{F \\cup M|D_f \\cap B}\\): number of data points in the gender subset form the fairface output, given they were black.\n\nThese were two specific hypothesis tests, however, we’ll be testing many combinations of these parameters and reporting back on any significant findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the report requirements\n\n\n\nAlso can be called “Analyses”\nThis section might contain several subsections as needed.\n\nAt least one subsection should describe the exploratory data analysis you did.\nWhat modifications were necessary to make the dataset ready for analysis?

    "text": "3.4 Standardizing output\nThe model outputs for both FairFace and DeepFace do not conform to the categories provided within the University of Tennessee - Knoxville (UTK) dataset. We elected to take the outputs from each model and modify them based upon the categories specified in the UTK dataset, namely:\n\n“[race] is an integer from 0 to 4, denoting White, Black, Asian, Indian, and Others (like Hispanic, Latino, Middle Eastern).”\n“[gender] is either 0 (male) or 1 (female)”\n“[age] is an integer from 0 to 116, indicating the age”\n\n\n3.4.1 From FairFace\n\nRace: The FairFace classification model had two options - one for “fair7” and one for “fair4.” The latter provided predictions of race in the following categories: [White, Black, Asian, Indian]. Of key note, the model omitted “Other” categories as listed in the race category for the UTK dataset. However, the “fair7” model provides predictions across [White, Black, Latino_Hispanic, East Asian, Southeast Asian, Indian, Middle Eastern]. We elected to use the the fair7 model, and to refactor the output categories to match those of the UTK dataset. Namely, we refactored instances of Middle Eastern and Latino_Hispanic as “Other,” and instances of “East Asian” and “Southeast Asian” as “Asian”\nAge: FairFace only provides a predicted age range as opposed to a specific, single, predicted age as a string. To enable comparison of actual values to the predicted values, we maintained this column as a categorical variable, and split it into a lower and upper bound of predicted age as an integer. This split will allow us to determine whether or not the prediction correctly binned the age (i.e. \\(lowerBound \\leq actualAge \\leq upperBound\\)), and if not - how far outside of those bounds the actual age lay.\nGender: no change to outputs of “Male” and “Female.”\n\n\n\n3.4.2 From DeepFace\n\nRace: Racial categorical output from DeepFace includes the following categories [“middle eastern”, “asian”, “white”, “latino hispanic”, “black”, “indian”]\nAge: DeepFace provides a prediction of a single, specific, predicted age. We elected to match the predicted age to be the same range as would be predicted by Fair Face. For example, if DeepFace predicts an age like “19,” we assign it the same matching category as it would have in FairFace - “10-19.” From there, we also split this category into an upper and lower bound. In spite of the fact that DeepFace does not provide any bounds or ranges on its age prediction outputs, to have a similar and fair comparison of both models, we give it those same upper and lower bounds for equitable comparison.\nGender: DeepFace outputs are “Man” and “Woman”, and we refactor those values to “Male” and “Female” respectively."

    "text": "3.5 Evaluating Permutations of Inputs and Models for Equitable Evaluation\nAside from the differences in the outputs of each model in terms of age, race, and gender, there are also substantial differences between FairFace and DeepFace in terms of their available settings when attempting to categorize an image in each of these categories.\nThe need for this permutation evaluation rose from some initial scripting and testing of these models on a small sample of images from another facial dataset - the Asian Face Age Dataset (need citation here). We immediately grew concerned with DeepFace’s performance using default settings (namely, enforcing requirement to detect a face prior to categorization, and using OpenCV as the default detection backend). Running these initial scripting tests, we encountered a failure rate in DeepFace of approximately 70% in identifying and categorizing an image of a face.\nWe performed further exploratory analysis on both models in light of these facts, and sought some specific permutations of settings to determine what settings may provide the most fair and equitable comparison of the models prior to proceeding to further analysis.\n\n3.5.1 DeepFace Analysis Options\nDeepFace has a robust degree of avaialble settings when performing facial categorization and recognition. These include enforcing facial detection prior to classification of an image, as well as 8 different facial detection models to detect a face prior to categorization. The default of these settings is OpenCV detection with detection enabled. Other detection backends include ssd, dlib, mtcnn, retinaface, mediapipe, yolov8, yunet, and fastmtcnn.\nIn a Python 3.8 environment, attempting to run detections using dlib, retinaface, mediapipe, yolov8, and yunet failed to run, or failed to install the appropriate models directly from source during exeuction. Repairing any challenges or issues with the core functionality of DeepFace and FairFace’s code is outside the scope of our work, and as such, we have excluded any of these non-functioning models from our permutation evaluation.\n\n\n3.5.2 FairFace Analysis Options\nThe default script from FairFace provided no options via its command line script to change settings. It uses dlib/resnet34 models for facial detection and image pre-processing, and uses its own fair4 and fair7 models for categorization. There are no other options or flags that can be set by a user when processing a batch of images.\nWe converted the simple script to a class in Python without addressing any feature bugs or errors in the underlying code. This change provided us some additional options when performing the analysis of an input image using FairFace - namely, the ability to analyze and categorize an image with or without facial detection, similar to the functionality of DeepFace. FairFace remains limited in the fact that is only detection model backend is built in dlib, but this change gives us more options when considering what type of images to use and what settings to use on both models before generating our final dataset for analysis.\n\n\n3.5.3 Specific Permutations\nWith the above options in mind, we designed the following permutations for evaluation on a subset of the UTK dataset:\n\n\n\n\n\nDetection\nDetection Model\nImage Source\nResults Output\n\n\n\n\nEnabled\nFairFace=Dlib; DeepFace=OpenCV\nPre-cropped\nnew_ff_c_p.csv, crop_df_p_opencv.csv\n\n\nEnabled\nFairFace=Dlib; DeepFace=OpenCV\nIn-The-Wild\nnew_ff_uc_p.csv, uncropped_df_p_opencv.csv\n\n\nEnabled\nFairFace=Dlib; DeepFace=mtcnn\nPre-cropped\nnew_ff_c_p.csv, crop_df_p_mtcnn.csv\n\n\nEnabled\nFairFace=Dlib; DeepFace=mtcnn\nIn-The-Wild\nnew_ff_uc_p.csv, uncropped_df_p_mtcnn.csv\n\n\nDisabled\nFairFace,DeepFace=None\nPre-cropped\nnew_ff_c_np.csv, cropped_df_np.csv\n\n\nDisabled\nFairFace,DeepFace=None\nIn-The-Wild\nnew_ff_uc_np.csv, uncropped_df_np.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe processed each of the above setting permutations againnst approximately 9800 images, consisting of images from part 1 of 3 from the UTK datset. Each of the cropped images (cropped_UTK_dataset.csv) and uncropped images (uncropped_UTK_dataset.csv) came from the same underlying subject in each image; the only difference between each image was whether or not it was pre-processed before evaluation by each model.\n\n\n\n3.5.4 Permutation Sample Results (LN & DV)\n(enforcement of facial detection, detection backend model, and cropped images vs. faces in-the-wild)\n\n\n3.5.5 Setting Selection\n\nUpon completion of our evaluation, we determined the settings that gave both models the best chance of success included enabling facial detection with mtcnn for DeepFace and Dlib for FairFace on uncropped images.\nFrom there, we proceeded to process the entirety of the UTK dataset using these settings. The only exception are 4 images that did not conform to UTK’s naming convention to identify age, gender, and race of the subject in the image.\nWe wrote a script, MasterScript.py, to enable us to perform batch iteration of images and generate output files. When processing, we generated both the non-normalized output content and normalized output content.\nDue to the resource-intensive design of FairFace, our script enables multiprocessing of FairFace to allow for multiple simultaneous instances of the FairFace class as a pool of worker threads to iterate over all of the source data.\nWe attempted the same methodology for DeepFace, but encountered issues with silent errors and halting program execution when iterating over all images using DeepFace. To alleviate this challenge, we processed DeepFace in a single-threaded manner, and with smaller portions of the dataset vs. pursuing an all-in-one go execution. We proceeded to store the data for each of these smaller runs in multiple output files to combine once we completed all processing requirements.\nThe following table outlines the output files.\nThe last file, MasterDataFrame.csv, is the final output of our evaluation. This file is in the following format, with the following column definitions:\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn Name\nDefinition\nData Type\n\n\n\n\nimg_path\nRelative path location of the file within the UTK dataset\ncharacter vector\n\n\nfile\nThe filename of each file within the UTK dataset\ncharacter vector\n\n\nsrc_age\nThe age of the subject in each image from the UTK dataset\ninteger\n\n\nsrc_gender\nThe gender of the subject in each image from the UTK dataset\ncharacter vector\n\n\nsrc_race\nThe race of the subject in each image from the UTK datset\ncharacter vector\n\n\nsrc_timestamp\nThe time at which the image was submitted to the UTK dataset\ncharacter vector\n\n\nsrc_age_grp\nThe age group (matching age ranges from the FairFace outputs) for each image in the UTK dataset\ncharacter vector\n\n\npred_model\nThe model used to produce the predicted output (FairFace or DeepFace)\ncharacter vector\n\n\npred_race\nThe race of the subject in the image predicted by the given prediction model\ncharacter vector\n\n\npred_gender\nThe gender of the subject in the image predicted by the given prediction model\ncharacter vector\n\n\npred_age_DF_only\nThe integer-predicted age by DeepFace of the subject in the image\ninteger\n\n\npred_age_grp\nThe age group of the subject in the image predicted by the given prediction model\ncharacter vector\n\n\npred_age_lower\nThe integer lower bound of the predicted age group\ninteger\n\n\npred_age_upper\nThe integer upper bound of the predicted age group\ninteger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarkkainen, Kimmo, and Jungseock Joo. 2021. “FairFace: Face Attribute Dataset for Balanced Race, Gender, and Age for Bias Measurement and Mitigation.” In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, 1548–58."
